% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order

% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP

\section{personal research statement}
%
Already, many critical parts of modern society rest on top of several layers
of computer software and hardware, and things will only become more complex
in the future. As with other engineering efforts, I believe that such systems
cannot meet the requirements of reliability and maintainability unless they are
built on solid, well specified and sound foundations.

To address this, and preferably further the state of the art, my research interests
lie in the various topics surrounding programming languages and language based
security. Programming languages
provide system designers with the necessary high-level abstractions to realize their
designs, and as such, programming languages and the related technologies need to be
all things to everyone. They must be expressive enough to allow the designer to
create a complete and maintainable system. They must be simple, so that the systems
they express can be understood and maintained. They must be built on solid foundations
which provide assurances of correctness, in many cases through mathematical verification.
All of this is important in the context of security, where language technology can
significantly contribute to the task of designing and implementing safe systems.

% I believe at the moment, functional and declarative programming languages deserve to
% be continued to be studied in detail, as they fit these requirements better in many
% ways that imperative languages cannot. I also believe that the use of formal specifications
% of their semantics (to the extent possible) is beneficial, both to build verifiable
% systems as well as providing language designers important insight into their languages.

\blankline

The main purpose of programming languages is to provide a mapping from a high-level
specification of a system to a lower level. The lower level can be abstract,
mathematical models of execution -- or it can be hardware or even a lower layer of
software (actually the most common case). I find great joy in studying such mappings,
designing new ones and finding ways to improve them.
A particularly useful application of such research is in security. Security issues
cross-cut the abstraction levels of systems, i.e. a system that appears safe on one
abstraction level may very well not be on another one. By building in helpful
features in the mapping between layers, namely programming languages, it is possible
to make it significantly easier to write verifiably safe systems.
% This particular joy sparks
% my interest in a wide range of topics, from low level compilation and interpretation
% of languages, to high level and abstract specifications of language semantics.

My experience and interest in the practicalities of programming and computer
architecture fuses rather well with my fascination for the theoretical aspect.
By combining these two, I'd like to gain even deeper understanding of the current
state of the art to be able to find ways to advance it.

\blankline

% To be more specific, my current research interest lies across process algebra,
% structural operational semantics and functional programming (preferably lazy,
% pure and strongly typed, e.g. Haskell). I am interested in using these areas
% of study to work on language based security, modelling and verification and efficient
% and correct execution (dynamic or compiled).

% qualifications for job offerings, please refer to the cover letter included
